# CSC550
This repository consists of assignments completed by my team for the course CSC 550 at Southern Connecticut State University. The first two assignments are based off of Hazem Saleh's Sound Recorder application (https://github.com/hazems/soundrecorder) and Cordova Exhibition application (https://github.com/hazems/cordova-exhibition). One of the goals of those assignments was to solve depreciation issues and learn how to adapt old code in order get it working as expected. The third application has a UI which is similar to the Sound Recorder application, but its JavaScript functions are entirely unique, as they were coded by myself and my team. This application, called the Fibonacci Sequence application, calculates Fibonacci Sequence values up to a certain point or at a certain point, while also displaying the elapsed time required for those calculations.
